# Planning Poker

Relatively simple planning poker app using socket.io

## Usage
On a running instance, navigate to <your-domain>/room/{whateverName}/ to join room whateverName.

## Setup

1. Build dist folder
   - `npm run build` for production
   - `npm run build-dev` for development
   - `npm run watch-dev` for dev watch-build

2. Run `npm run serve`
3. It will now be served from your IP/server

## TODOs

- Allow to scale up to multiple servers
- Better UI
